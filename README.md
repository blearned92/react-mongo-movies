<b><h1 style="text-align: center;"> Mongo Movies (Front End) </h1></b>

## About:

&emsp; Mongo Movies allows users to view movies, and leave reviews. More features will come soon.

&emsp; This project served for me to learn and use MongoDB, and to practice more with Bootstrap and MUI for visual design, while also aiming to create more cleanly structured code with higher levels of organization than I have in the past.
